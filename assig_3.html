<h3>Traveling in Depression</h3>
<p>When i was little, I cought the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought me to their home In France and i have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has given me a unique learning experience.</p>
<p>At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the city of light. When I was eight, I stood in the heart of piazza san marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down venetion waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge<img src="girl.jpg" alt="girl.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 1%"> and walk along the great wall of china, amazed that the thousand-year-old stone where still in place.
</p>
<p>I was through exploring culture around the world that I first became interested in language
</p>
<p>It began with French, which taught me the importance of pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des pyramids was. But when I pronuced it PRY-a-mides instead of Pyr-A-mides, with more accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered
</p>
<p>In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and aware of it similarities with English through congnates. baseball in Spanish, for example, is beishol, which looks different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible 
</p>
<p>Then in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As i studied Chinese at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character and i can feel the beauty and rhyme as I form then .
